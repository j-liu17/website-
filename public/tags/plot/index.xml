      <description>About Me!My name is Joy! I was born in Dallas, Texas and I moved to Austin in 2016 for college. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology and a certificate in Pre-Health Professions. Iâ€™m planning on attending the PA program at the University of Texas Medical Branch, starting in July 2020. I am really passionate about healthcare and also spreading education and awareness about current topics in medicine.</description>
