Though the majority of SDS 348 was focused on getting more comfortable with R, I learned some Python at the end. Though I had already learned some Python in previous coding classes, I had never learned about regex (regular expressions) before. This method of finding parts in strings was really interesting to me!

Here's an example of what we did in our homeworks:

Using re.findall(), match all numbers and pull them from the following string (string1). Your results should look like this.
['12',
 '47',
 '48',
 '189',
 '2036',
 '314',
 '125',
 '789',
 '1450',
 '564',
 '90456',
 '7890']

```{python 3}

import re

string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"

re.findall(r"\d+", string1)

```
