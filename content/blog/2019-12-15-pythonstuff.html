<p>Though the majority of SDS 348 was focused on getting more comfortable with R, I learned some Python at the end. Though I had already learned some Python in previous coding classes, I had never learned about regex (regular expressions) before. This method of finding parts in strings was really interesting to me!</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what we did in our homeworks:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(rep(&#39;/img/q1.jpg&#39;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/img/q1.jpg" /><!-- --></p>
<pre class="python"><code>
import re

string1=&quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&#39;,\&#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking&quot;

re.findall(r&quot;\d+&quot;, string1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;12&#39;, &#39;47&#39;, &#39;48&#39;, &#39;189&#39;, &#39;2036&#39;, &#39;314&#39;, &#39;125&#39;, &#39;789&#39;, &#39;1450&#39;, &#39;564&#39;, &#39;90456&#39;, &#39;7890&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>We also did many more examples where we had to find IP addresses and websites from other strings. Finally, we got to find restriction enzyme sequences in a stretch of nucleotides, which is useful for biology purposes!</p>
