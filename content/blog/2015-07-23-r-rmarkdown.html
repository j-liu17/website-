<div id="about-me" class="section level1">
<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>My name is Joy! I was born in Dallas, Texas and I moved to Austin in 2016 for college. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science and Arts in Biology and a certificate in Pre-Health Professions. I’m planning on attending the PA program at the University of Texas Medical Branch, starting in July 2020. I am really passionate about healthcare and also spreading education and awareness about current topics in medicine. In my spare time, I like to read and I have been learning how to cook.</p>
