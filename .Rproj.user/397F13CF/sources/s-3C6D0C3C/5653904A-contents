Though the majority of SDS 348 was focused on getting more comfortable with R, I learned some Python at the end. Though I had already learned some Python in previous coding classes, I had never learned about regex (regular expressions) before. This method of finding parts in strings was really interesting to me!

Here's an example of what we did in our homeworks:

```{r knitr-logo, fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('/img/q1.jpg'))

```


```{python 3}

import re

string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"

re.findall(r"\d+", string1)

```

We also did many more examples where we had to find IP addresses and websites from other strings. Finally, we got to find restriction enzyme sequences in a stretch of nucleotides, which is useful for biology purposes!
